<h2>Confussion and Diffusion in Classical Algorithms</h2>
This tool is made with some of the classical algorithms, it shows the encryption and decryption using Caesar Cipher, Playfair Cipher, Rail Fence Cipher, and Columnar Cipher and a mix of all of them. It can be used with files or just input a simple string.

<h2>Java Version</h2>
<ul>
  <li>java 19.0.2 2023-01-17</li>
  <li>Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 19.0.2+7-44)</li>
  <li>Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.0.2+7-44, mixed mode, sharing)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h4>Encryption:</h4>
<ol>
  <li> Select the desired algorithm to encrypt with. </li>
  <li> Input the value of the key to encrypt with.</li>
  <li> Either enter a string input to the specifed text-box in the javaFX user interface (UI).</li>
  <li> Or you choose a file from your computer as an input and it has in it the plain-text. </li>
  <li> Select the output file that will have the encrypted text in it (cipher-text). </li>
  <li>Click on the "Encrypt" button for a string and "Encrypt File" button for text files.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Decryption:</h4>
<ol>
  <li> Select the desired algorithm to decrypt with. </li>
  <li> Input the value of the key to decrypt with.</li>
  <li> Either enter a string input to the specifed text-box in the javaFX user interface (UI).</li>
  <li> Or you choose a file from your computer as an input and it has in it the encrypted text (cipher-text). </li>
  <li> Select the output file that will have the original text in it. </li>
  <li>Click on the "Decrypt" button for a string and "Decrypt File" button for text files.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Security</h2>
The application doesnt store any of the files you use, it's all locally on your machine.
